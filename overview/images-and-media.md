# Key concepts

Fintag is built around simplifying blockchain interactions while maintaining decentralization and security. At its core, it relies on three foundational concepts: **Identity, Handles, and Resolution**.

#### 1. Identity

Identity in Fintag represents your unique presence on the blockchain without relying on cryptographic wallet addresses. It’s a human-readable, social-first representation of your account. With Fintag, identity is portable and consistent across platforms, allowing you to interact, transact, and manage assets using a single recognizable identity.

Key points:

* Human-readable: No more long, complex wallet addresses.
* Portable: Your identity can be used across apps, bots, and integrations.
* Secure & Decentralized: Linked to your blockchain accounts, ensuring ownership and authenticity.

#### 2. Fintag Handles

Handles are the shorthand names tied to your Fintag identity. Think of them as your “username” for crypto. They allow anyone to send tokens, view transaction history, or interact with your identity without needing to know technical wallet addresses.

Key points:

* Unique: Each handle is distinct across the Fintag ecosystem.
* Memorable & Social: Handles make transactions as easy as sending a message.
* Flexible: You can manage multiple handles for different use cases (personal, business, communities).

#### 3. Resolution

Resolution is the process that links a handle to its underlying blockchain accounts. When someone sends crypto to a handle, Fintag’s resolution system ensures it reaches the correct wallet instantly. This system is fast, decentralized, and accurate, removing friction from blockchain interactions.

Key points:

* Instant mapping: Converts handles to wallet addresses in real-time.
* Cross-platform: Works across messaging apps, platforms, and integrations.
* Trustless & Secure: Maintains blockchain verification standards while abstracting complexity.
