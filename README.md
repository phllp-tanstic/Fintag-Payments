# Fintag-Payments
Fintag Product Documentation

Welcome to the official Fintag documentation.
Fintag is an identity-first crypto payments and token infrastructure that lets users and developers move value using human‑readable handles instead of wallet addresses. Our mission is simple: replace wallet addresses with identity and bring crypto natively into social communication.

What is Fintag?
Fintag allows users to send, receive, and manage digital assets directly inside social platforms like Telegram using simple identity tags (e.g. #username). No copy‑paste wallet addresses. No additional apps. Crypto payments finally feel like messaging.

On the infrastructure side, Fintag provides APIs and SDKs that enable developers to integrate identity‑based payments, token transfers, swaps, and on‑chain interactions into their own products.
